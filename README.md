# Reasons for using this framework

I changed to this framework, because i was not happy with the performance of the other one TODO and since I already look for a sparse implementation, I thought this may be a viable starting point. Unfortunately the Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm is not implemented, but I aim to add it.


# 1st Step - Testing

Before I will use this framework, I made sure that the main.rs example works as expected. The execution is fast and the prediction is correct. Now I will try to learn a 1D benchmark function, like in the last framework.

# 2nd Step - Restructuring

I am really unhappy with the structure of the framework and will change it.
